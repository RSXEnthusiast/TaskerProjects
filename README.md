Personal Tasker Projects

Each branch is a different project and will include a text file with the "code," and a link to download the project to your phone and try it out (if you have Tasker installed).

Tasker is a phone automation software, using a lot of visual programming in a rather custom "language." While it's not exactly writing code, I've had to apply a lot of the logic and skills I've learned to learn and effectively use Tasker.
